## 2/8/23 - Working (so far) proof of concept
I have finally (after a fair bit of research and experimenting) found what i think is a way to transmit data across the internet without haveing to use a relay server or portforward. 
so far i have tested with a connection to my VPS (hosted offsite by binarylane) and a connection to my friend in America. so far it works as planned, but more testing is needed.
Now that i have a fucntional prototype i will start to work on the rest of the app and encryption.
