# PTP-Chat-App
This is a simple yet secure peer to peer chat app

# What is this app
The idea of this app is based on crypto, A decentralised web. This is a app that uses an encrypted peer to peer connection to allow you to send messages over the internet securley. It utilizes TLS and Public/Private key encryption (asymetric) to make this all work.
While one instance can only be in one chat at a time, you can run more instances to have multiple chats. Note the chat will be cleared when both parties disconnect.
